# Web-Development-Bootcamp
This repository contains all the projects I completed as part of the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp 2024. Each project demonstrates the skills and technologies I learned, including front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as back-end development using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. You'll also find projects on blockchain development and Web3, highlighting my journey through the course and my ability to build modern, full-stack web applications. Feel free to explore the projects and see the progression of my learning and development.
